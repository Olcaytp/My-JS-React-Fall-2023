- What is the main difference between using `if-else` statements and a `switch` statement in JavaScript?
    
The main difference lies in the way they handle multiple conditions. "if-else" statements allow you to evaluate 
complex conditions and provide flexibility, while a "switch" statement is useful when you have a single value to 
compare against multiple cases.
