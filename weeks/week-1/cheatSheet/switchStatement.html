- What is the purpose of the `switch` statement in JavaScript?
    
The "switch" statement provides a way to select one of many code blocks to be executed. It allows you to compare a single value against multiple cases and execute the code block that matches the value.

    // Example
    let day = 3
    let dayName
    
    switch (day) {
      case 1:
        dayName = "Monday"
        break
      case 2:
        dayName = "Tuesday"
        break
      case 3:
        dayName = "Wednesday"
        break
      case 4:
        dayName = "Thursday"
        break
      case 5:
        dayName = "Friday"
        break
      default:
        dayName = "Unknown"
        break
    }
    
    console.log("Today is " + dayName + ".")
