- How does the `if` statement work in JavaScript?
    
The "if" statement is the most basic conditional statement. It checks a condition and executes a block of code if the 
condition is true. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

// Example 
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.")
}
