What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?

- **`var`** has function scope and can be redeclared and reassigned.
- **`let`** has block scope and can be reassigned but not redeclared.
- **`const`** has block scope and cannot be redeclared or reassigned (except for objects and arrays, where their internal values can be modified).
