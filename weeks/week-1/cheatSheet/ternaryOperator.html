In JavaScript, a ternary operator is a shorthand way to write a simple conditional statement. 
Itâ€™s a compact way to make a decision and choose between two values or expressions based on a condition. 
The syntax of a ternary operator is:

condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

`condition` is the condition that you want to evaluate.

`expressionIfTrue` is the value or expression that gets returned if the condition is true.

`expressionIfFalse` is the value or expression that gets returned if the condition is false.

Here is an example:

const age = 26
const pizzaSize = age >= 18 ? "Adult size pizza" : "Child sized pizza"
