- When should I use an `if-else` statement instead of a `switch` statement in JavaScript?
    
You should use an "if-else" statement when you need to evaluate conditions based on various expressions, 
perform complex comparisons, or when the conditions are not easily reduced to a single value. It provides 
more flexibility and supports a wide range of conditions.
