- What is the purpose of the `break` statement in the `switch` statement?
    
The "break" statement is used within each case of a "switch" statement. It is used to terminate the execution 
of the current case and prevents the code from falling through to the next case. Without a "break" statement, 
execution would continue to the next case, resulting in unexpected behaviour.
