- What is the purpose of the `else` statement in JavaScript?
    
The "else" statement is used in conjunction with the "if" statement. It allows you to specify an alternate 
block of code to execute when the condition of the "if" statement is false.

    // Example 

    if (grade >= 60) {
      console.log("You passed the exam.")
    } else {
      console.log("You failed the exam.")
    }
