# API Basics
ðŸ’¡ An API, or **Application Programming Interface**, is a set of protocols allowing different software applications to 
communicate. 
By using APIs, developers can access external data or functionality, making it possible to integrate different services 
into a single application. 
In web development, APIs are often used to fetch data from external sources, such as weather information or social media feeds, 
and display it on a website.

- What does API stand for?
    
    API stands for Application Programming Interface.
    
- How do APIs work?
    
    Different JavaScript APIs work in slightly different ways, but generally, they have common features and similar themes 
    to how they work. They are based on objects. 
    
    Your code interacts with APIs using one or moreÂ [JavaScript objects]
    (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects), which serve as containers for the data the API uses 
    (contained in object properties), and the functionality the API makes available (contained in object methods).
    
- What are browser APIs?
    
    **Browser APIs**Â are built into your web browser and are able to expose data from the browser and surrounding computer 
    environment and do useful complex things with it. Such as the web page, user interface elements, browser features, and more.

- What are third-party APIs?
    
    **Third-party APIs**Â are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to retrieve their code and 
    information from somewhere on the Web. For example, theÂ [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)Â allows you 
    to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website. It provides a special set of constructs you can use 
    to query the Twitter service and return specific information.

    - What is the role of API documentation, and why is it important?
    
    API documentation provides developers with instructions, examples, and details about how to interact with an API. It
    explains the available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication requirements, and more. API documentation 
    is crucial as it helps developers understand and effectively use the API, reducing the learning curve and enabling 
    smoother integration into their applications.
    
- What is an HTTP request?
    
    An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (such as a web browser) to a server, requesting a specific action 
    to be performed, such as retrieving a web page or submitting form data.
    
- What are the commonly used HTTP request methods?
    
    The commonly used HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.
    
- What is the purpose of the GET method?
    
    The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. It appends the data to the URL as query parameters and is suitable
    for requesting resources or data without changing the server's state.
    
- What is the purpose of the POST method?
    
    The POST method is used to submit data to the server to create or update a resource. It sends data in the request body and
    is commonly used for form submissions or API requests that modify server data.
    
- What is the difference between PUT and PATCH methods?
    
    The PUT method is used to update an entire resource on the server, replacing it with the new data sent in the request.
    In contrast, the PATCH method is used to partially update a resource, applying changes specified in the request body
    without replacing the entire resource.
