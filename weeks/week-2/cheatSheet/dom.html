- What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?
The DOM is a programming interface for web documents that represents the structure and content of a web page.
It allows JavaScript to interact with HTML elements and modify their properties, styles, and content.

- How does JavaScript access elements in the DOM?
	JavaScript can access elements in the DOM using various methods, such as **`getElementById`**, 
	**`getElementsByClassName`**, **`getElementsByTagName`**, or **`querySelector`**. 
	These methods return references to the selected elements, which can be used to manipulate them.

- How can I change the content of an HTML element using the DOM?
    You can change the content of an HTML element by accessing its **`innerHTML`** property and assigning 
	a new value to it. For example, **`document.getElementById('myElement').innerHTML = 'New content'`** would 
	change the content of the element with the ID 'myElement'.
    This example would change the content of the element with the ID 'myElement'.

- How can I change the attributes of an HTML element using the DOM?
    You can change the attributes of an HTML element by accessing its corresponding property in the DOM. 
	For instance, to change the **`src`** attribute of an image element, you can use 
	**`document.getElementById('myImage').src = 'newimage.jpg'`**

- How can I add a new HTML element to the DOM dynamically?
    You can create a new element using the **`createElement`** method, set its properties and content, 
	and then append it to an existing element using methods like **`appendChild`** or **`insertBefore`**

- How can I remove an HTML element from the DOM?
    You can remove an HTML element from the DOM by accessing its parent element and using the 
	**`removeChild`** method. For example, **`parentElement.removeChild(childElement)`** will remove the 
	specified child element.

- How can I handle events using the DOM?
    You can handle events in JavaScript by using event listeners. You can attach an event listener to an
	element using methods like **`addEventListener`** and specify a function to be executed when the 
	event occurs.

- What is the difference between the **`innerText`** and **`innerHTML`** properties?
    The **`innerText`** property represents the visible text content of an element, excluding any HTML tags. 
	On the other hand, the **`innerHTML`** property represents the HTML content, including tags, within an 
	element.

- How can I traverse and manipulate the DOM tree?
    You can traverse and manipulate the DOM tree by using properties and methods like **`parentNode`**, 
	**`childNodes`**, **`nextSibling`**, **`previousSibling`**, **`firstChild`**, and **`lastChild`**. 
	These allow you to navigate through the hierarchical structure of the DOM.
    
- How can I handle form input and retrieve user input using the DOM?
    To handle form input, you can access form elements using their IDs or other methods like 
	**`querySelector`**. You can then retrieve user input using the **`value`** property of the form element. 
	For example, **`document.getElementById('myInput').value`** would retrieve the value entered in an input 
	field with the ID 'myInput'.
    
- How can I check if an element has a specific CSS class using the DOM?
    You can check if an element has a specific CSS class by using the **`classList`** property. 
	The **`classList`** object provides methods like **`contains`** to check if a class is present on the element.
	For example, **`element.classList.contains('myClass')`** would return **`true`** if the element has the class 
	'myClass'.

- How can I add a class to an HTML element using the DOM?
    You can add a class to an HTML element using the **`classList`** property and its **`add`** method. 
	For example, **`element.classList.add('highlight')`** would add the class 'highlight' to the element.
    
- How can I toggle a class on an HTML element using the DOM?
    You can toggle a class on an HTML element using the **`classList`** property and its **`toggle`** method. 
	For example, **`element.classList.toggle('active')`** would add the class 'active' to the element if it 
	doesn't have it, and remove it if it already exists.
